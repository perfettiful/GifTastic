Overview
In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.
1.  Create array of strings- each related to topic of interest- save to a var called 'topics' (suggestion = animals);
2. Take topics from the array and create buttons
3. When User clicks a button, page should grab 10 images from Giphy API and place them on the page
4. When user clicks a still giphy image, the gif should animate, if user clicks gif again, it should stop
5. Under every Gif, display rating (pg, etc)
5. Add a FORM that takes user input and adds it to the 'topics' array.  Then make a function call that takes each topicand remakes the buttons on the page.  
6.  Deploy to Github Pages
Bonus Goals-
1.  Mobile Responsiveness
2. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page- each req should add 10 gifs, not ovewrite existing gifs
3. List Addtl Metadata for each gif in a clean/readable format
4. Include a 1 click download button for each Gif- this should work on multiple device types
5. integrate search with addtl api's like OMDB or bands in town.  Be creative
6. Allow users to add gifs to a favorites section
7. Major Challange:  Make the favorites section remain even after page is loaded
